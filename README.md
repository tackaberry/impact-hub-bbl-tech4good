# How Technology and the People Behind it are Making the World a Better Place

## Impact Hub - Brown Bag Lunch - Tech4Good

**Thursday June 3 @ 12- 1PM**

Delve into the changing role being played by big and small tech corporations to increase their impact and make the world a better place

In this Brown Bag Lunch, we’ll explore how tech is being used as a strategic resource to make the world a better place. We’ll look into the role being played by big and small tech corporations and how the “in-kind” space is changing. We’ll also touch on basic cloud concepts and how that work is creating an impact. Then to wrap up, we’ll discuss how you can get involved and play a part.

Brown Bag Lunches are Impact Hub Ottawa’s weekly lunch & learns led by Hubbers, for members and non-members alike. Topics vary each week, but you’re always sure to learn something new!
